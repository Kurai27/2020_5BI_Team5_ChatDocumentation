# Introduction

The Chat protocol consists in a program that implements a realtime chat between 2 or more users, they can login on the same server and are able to chat each others

# Terminology

Server- a program running on a machine where all the users can login and chat each others

User- a single person that create an account to be able to login in the server

Username/Password- unique identifiers that authenticate and validates a user

# Functions Tested

Functions that will be tested during the testing phase:

- The capability to chat between 2 client while they are connected on a server

- Being able to login or sign up with a custom user and password

# Functions Not Tested

There are features that will not be included in the current testing procedure like:

- Checking if there are 2 or more user with the same name

- Function to change an user password

# Approach

Before starting to write down code you&#39;ll have to plan every features you will implement in. Starting with the main section, the server.

Once completed you will check if it&#39;s working properly and then, you will pass to the next section, the chat. You&#39;ll have to create a working login-signup function to be able next, to login on the server. Finally the last part, also the program itself, the chat.

# Testing Tasks

The following list the testing deliverables and the activities required to produce the deliverable.

| **Deliverables** | **Activities** |
| --- | --- |
| **Test Plan** |
- All the functions have to be optimized
- Determine Testable/Non-Testable Features
- Plan all the feature to implement before starting

 |
| **Test Specifications** |
- Before the chat initializes the server need to be on

 |
| **Test reports** |
- Check if there aren&#39;t errors during the execution
- Check if the login protocol works properly
