## **Success Criteria For _Chat Protocol_ Project**

##### The Chat Protocol Project will be considered a success if...

###### **A fully functional system is delivered before June 21st**

The system shall be delivered in a state that is ready to be used in its intended production environment for its intended purpose. The users are able to utilize the system without training.
We will consider both of these goals met if the users who plan to use the system during its test period fill out the attached _Acceptance Test User Survey_ and:

  - No one circles "No" on the first two questions
  - If anyone circles "Yes, with reservations" on the first two questions, these reservations shall be resolved prior to July 6th to the satisfaction of the users with the reservations

##### **Concerns raised during the test peiod are addressed according to the problem resolution plan containe in the Software Project Management Plan**

All critical defects found before July 10th wll be fixed. A critical defect is one for which there is no convenient workaround. Beyond fixing defects, requested changes will be handled on a sliding scale
Changes taking 30 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 3 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 20 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 2 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 10 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 1 week before the scheduled end of the project.
Users shall be notified of their rights and responsibilities under this policy prior to the start of acceptance test.

##### **Marconi students can easily log into the system.**
This specifically means that a student will be able to select the login option, type their first and last name or some portion of their first and/or last name, select events and press a confirmation button.

##### **Raw data on Youth, activities and volunteers is available for download**
Moderators shall be able to download raw data on Students and their activities in order to produce ad hoc reports.

##### **The system is properly documented**
A user guide and manual will be produced and distributed online with the code. A student should be able to read the guide and comprehend it by simply reading it in less than an hour .
